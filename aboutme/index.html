    <h2>Ney</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Jared, and some close friends call me "Ney" just because I like to play football,
     and they put me the nick name "Ney" because of Neymar, the professional footballer. <br> I'm 24 years old, and I was born into the covenant. I served
     a mission in Mexico, the Mexico Tijuana Mission, and more than a year late I got married. <br> I'm married about 2 years ago and I have a 7 months baby. 
     I'm currently working at a real state company in the marketing digital area. <br>
     My native language is spanish, because I'm mexican. I took the opportunity to study in BYU-Pathway because I want to increase my english skills
    and also find a better opportunity for a job.</p>
